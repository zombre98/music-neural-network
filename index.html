<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>We have divided the project into 3 separate parties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Extraction from the music cheats: Antoine Lefebvre</li>
    <li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Thomas Burgaud</li>
    <li>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Armand M&eacute;grot</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In order not to get lost in the project and to have an efficient follow-up, we have weekly meetings (every Friday
    evening).
</p>
<h2>Important research documents</h2>

    Like our organization the code is divided into 3 parts: Features, LSTM and CNN.<br/>

All the .html and .py files that are in this folder they are just files generated by our notebook to be
able to read us and share our code

<h2>Responsibility for the Code</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Antoine Lefebvre:</b><br/>
        For this project, he was in charge of extracting features from the music cheat. He uses
        different libraries to parse MIDI files in order to deduce information that can be interesting for learning and
        therefore author recognition.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Armand M&eacute;grot:</b><br/>
        He created an LSTM Neural Network to be able to recognize the music through Antoine's features.
        Armand also configured TensorflowGPU to be able to train Artificial Intelligence faster.
        Some models would have taken several days to train if we couldn't use Armand's graphics card.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Thomas Burgaud:</b><br/>
        As explained above Thomas is busy exploring a music classification system through a Convolutional Neural
        Network.
        So he used Antoine's work to try to learn the interesting features to deduce the author of a music through these
        notes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>The goal of this project was to explore the classification of music through several models of Artificial
    Intelligence. Some of the results are not very convincing since their use is not useful in this kind of problem. The
    results are very different between Artificial Intelligence since their implementation is very different depending on
    their structure, their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
