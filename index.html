<h2>Organisation</h2>
<p>We have divided the project into 3 separate parties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Extraction from the music cheats: Antoine Lefebvre</li>
    <li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Thomas Burgaud</li>
    <li>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Armand Mégrot</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In order not to get lost in the project and to have an efficient follow-up, we have weekly meetings (every Friday
    evening).
</p>

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>For this project, we use GitHub,&nbsp;here is the link to our public repository:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/zombre98/music-neural-network">https://github.com/zombre98/music-neural-network</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Like our organization the code is divided into 3 parts: Features, LSTM and CNN.<br/>
    In the <a href="./app/">app</a> folder you will find the 3 parts.<br/>
    The <a href="./app/features/">features</a> folder which implements a Python
    <a href="./app/features/MidiData.py">MidiData</a> class. This
    class allows us to parse the files of our dataset and extract features that our artificial intelligences can learn.
    To do this there is a <a href="./app/features/TypeData.py">TypeData</a> subclass that offers an interface to extract
    notes or tempos.<br/>
    The <a href="./app/features/lstm/">LSTM</a> folder contains 2 notebooks that allow us to test our LSTM model faster!
    The file <a href="./app/lstm/LSTM_over_notes.ipynb">LSTM_over_notes.ipynb</a> and
    the file <a href="./app/lstm/LSTM_on_binary.ipynb">LSTM_on_binary.ipynb</a> these two implementation of 2
    model LSTM try for one to recognize the music thanks to
    the notes of the file extracted from the MidiData classes. The second file is an attempt to implement an LSTM which
    analyzes the file just by reading it without any analysis.
    Regarding the .html and .py files that are in this folder they are just files generated by our notebook to be able
    to
    read us and share our code<br/>
    The <a href="./app/features/cnn/">CNN</a> folder is organized in the same way as the LSTM folder it also contains an
    exploration of another model of
    Artificial Intelligence. We also find there the file
    <a href="./app/cnn/CNN_over_notes.ipynb">CNN_over_notes.ipynb</a> which is a notebook to be able to easily
    launch new Artificial Inteligence configuration it contains a model that tries to analyze the notes of a music!
    Regarding the organization of the rest of the folder we decided to push the <a href="data/maestro-v2.0.0">dataset</a>  with the files that allow us to
    read it with <a href="./data/maestro-v2.0.0/maestro-v2.0.0.csv">maestro-v2.0.0.json</a>.

<h2>Responsibility for the Code</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Antoine Lefebvre:</b><br/>
        For this project, he was in charge of extracting features from the music cheat. He uses
        different libraries to parse MIDI files in order to deduce information that can be interesting for learning and
        therefore author recognition.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Armand Mégrot:</b><br/>
        He created an LSTM Neural Network to be able to recognize the music through Antoine's features.
        Armand also configured TensorflowGPU to be able to train Artificial Intelligence faster.
        Some models would have taken several days to train if we couldn't use Armand's graphics card.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Thomas Burgaud:</b><br/>
        As explained above Thomas is busy exploring a music classification system through a Convolutional Neural
        Network.
        So he used Antoine's work to try to learn the interesting features to deduce the author of a music through these
        notes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>The goal of this project was to explore the classification of music through several models of Artificial
    Intelligence. Some of the results are not very convincing since their use is not useful in this kind of problem. The
    results are very different between Artificial Intelligence since their implementation is very different depending on
    their structure, their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
